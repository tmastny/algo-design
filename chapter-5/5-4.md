[3] Prove that in a breadth-first search on a undirected graph G,
every edge is either a tree edge or a cross edge, where x is neither
an ancestor nor descendant of y, in cross edge (x,y).

Recall from section 5.10 that this does not hold for depth-first search:
> every edge is either in the depth-first search tree or a
back edge to an ancestor in the tree

Note figure 5.9.

Suppose we enter the bfs search in y. Then if searching the adjacent nodes,
x cannot be the parent node because the parent node is already discovered.

Moreover, y cannot be a descendant of x, because y would have already been
discovered in the bfs search of x.

And finally, y cannot be an ancestor of x, because y just became discovered.

Therefore, edge(x, y) must be a cross-edge (edges that have the same parent),
or x must be a tree edge.
