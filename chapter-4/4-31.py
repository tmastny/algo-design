# [3] Suppose you are given an array A of n sorted numbers
# that has been circularly shifted k positions to the right.
# For example, {35, 42, 5, 15, 27, 29} is a sorted array that
# has been circularly shifted k = 2 positions, while
# {27, 29, 35, 42, 5, 15} has been shifted k = 4 positions.
# • Suppose you know what k is. Give an O(1) algorithm to find
#   the largest number in A.
# • Suppose you do not know what k is. Give an O(lgn) algorithm
#   to find the largest number in A. For partial credit, you may give
#   an O(n) algorithm.
